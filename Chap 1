CHAPTER 1: On 26th January, 2001, a devastating earthquake struck the Western Indian state of Gujarat and caused thousand of deaths and widespread destruction. Between 16000-25000 people lost their lives, 1700+ schools/ colleges and more than 1.7 million people were left homeless. Most of the earthquake's wrath was directed towards already very poor area of Kachchh in Gujarat. This disaster which followed after a wrenching drought last year, made living here even more terrible. Many of them who survived, were panic stricken, running for life after the temblor. There was an unnatural silence all around. This was a remembrance of the the tragedy that took relationships to a distance that can't be measured any further.

All of the tragic blues, people arouse a sense of realization and awareness towards the unseen forces, that exist in the form of Natural disasters. 
But not all have seen this with same perspective. May be the nature is unfair or as some believed maybe we are all blindfolded with a plausible reality depicted as an actual truth.
